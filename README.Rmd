# datasus

The "datasus" R package seeks to provide direct access to the data of TABNET/DATASUS 
within the R environment much in the same way that is done in the online portal. For now
the package allows access to the systematic record of mortality and survival data 
(Vital Statistics - Mortality and Live Births) through SIM and SINASC's systems

## Installation

To install the development version hosted on Github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rpradosiqueira/datasus")
```

## Example

In this example we will download the last mortality data for the IBGE's micro-region where the micro-regions are in the rows and the ICD-10 chapters in the columns:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sim_obt10_mun(linha = "Microrregião IBGE",
              coluna = "Capítulo CID-10")

```
